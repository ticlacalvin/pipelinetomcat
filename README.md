This application provides the time of the day and says Hello World!then build with Maven. We created an XML file named pom.xml. Among other things, this file gives the project’s name, version, and dependencies that it has on external libraries. The name of the JAR file will be based on the project’s artifactID and version. For example, given the pom.xml file, the JAR file is named gs-maven-0.1.0.jar. This application has two dependencies: Joda Time libraries (to print the current date and time) and JUnit (for Test)
